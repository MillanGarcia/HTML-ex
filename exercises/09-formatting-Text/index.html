		<h1>This will be your heading</h1>
		<p>Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read</p>
		<p>Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>
		<blockquote>
			A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble<br />
			of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business<br />
			<br />- A.A.Milne, If I May
		</blockquote>
		Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new<br />
		generationes have this things in common:
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read longs texts.</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attenton of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullets points.</li>
		</ul>
